Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? O(n), as it must traverse the full binary structure

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? O(k), where k is the maximum depth of the tree, as that is how full the stack could get

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n), as it must traverse the full binary structure

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n) in worst case, as the graph could be fully in the queue

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n^2), two nested loops

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n), 2 lists fitting the full amount of input

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n) I think, using dictionary, assuming O(1) lookup in dictionaries

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n), will make a dictionary the size of the input
